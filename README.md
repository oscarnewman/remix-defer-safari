Minimal reproduction of `defer` not working for SSR in desktop safari.

Tested in:

Safari Version 16.1 (18614.2.9.1.12), MacOs Ventura 13.0.1 (Does not work)
iOS Safari (ios 16.0) (Does not work)
Firefox 109.0 (Works)

All on an Apple Silicon Mac.

Client-side navigations always work as expected, in all browser.
